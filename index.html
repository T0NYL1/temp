            <h2>Breif description</h2>
            <p>Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands. </p>
            <p>During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his father goes to bed.</p>
